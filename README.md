Hi there, I'm Rooney Mwathani 👋

### 🧠 PyTorch & ML Specialist | Independent Learner

A highly motivated, **self-directed learner** focusing on the PyTorch Deep Learning framework. I command the full suite of Python ML libraries (Pandas, NumPy, SKlearn) and dedicate my time to building high-accuracy predictive models. 

My journey is driven by discipline and a passion for data integrity, which ensures my models are not only accurate but also reliable and well-tested.
